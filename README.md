# Astacid
A DejaVu-based font for programming.

Astacid is based mostly on [DejaVu Sans Mono - Bront](https://github.com/chrismwendt/bront), but includes glyphs from Hack and Ubuntu Mono.
Changes made to **DejaVu Sans Mono - Bront** include:

- `(` and `)` are not tapered
- `*` matches the size of `+`
- `-` is slightly narrower
- `^` is larger and more sharply angled
- `{` and `}` are enlarged
- `~` is curlier
